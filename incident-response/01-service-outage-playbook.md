# Service Outage Playbook

This playbook provides a structured approach for responding to service outages in the Chatbot Fluxa application. A service outage is defined as a situation where the application is completely unavailable or a critical function is not working for all or a significant portion of users.

## Severity Classification

| Aspect | Classification | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Default Severity** | P1 - Critical | Complete outages are always treated as critical |
| **Response Time** | 15 minutes | Team must acknowledge and begin response |
| **Resolution Time Target** | 4 hours | Maximum time to resolve the incident |
| **Escalation Path** | Technical Lead → Engineering Manager → CTO | Escalate if not resolved within timeframes |

## Triggers

A service outage incident may be triggered by:

- **Automated Alerts**:
  - Health check endpoint (`/api/health`) returns non-200 status code
  - Health check endpoint is unreachable for > 2 minutes
  - Synthetic monitoring tests fail completely
  - UptimeRobot alerts for service downtime

- **User Reports**:
  - Multiple users reporting application unavailability
  - Customer support reporting widespread access issues

- **Internal Detection**:
  - Team member discovers the service is down
  - Deployment pipeline reports critical failures

## Initial Assessment

### 1. Verify the Outage

- Check if the service is down for all users or just a subset
- Verify from multiple locations/networks to rule out network issues
- Check if the issue affects all environments (production, staging, etc.)
- Determine if the outage is complete or partial

### 2. Assess Impact

- Estimate the number of affected users
- Identify affected functionality
- Determine business impact (revenue loss, reputation damage, etc.)
- Check if data integrity is at risk

### 3. Identify Scope

- Determine if the issue is limited to the application or affects other systems
- Check if the issue is related to a specific component (frontend, backend, database)
- Verify if third-party dependencies are involved
- Check recent deployments or changes

## Response Procedure

### Phase 1: Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)

1. **Assemble Response Team**
   - Notify on-call engineer
   - Assign Incident Commander
   - Notify Technical Lead
   - Create incident channel in Slack

2. **Begin Investigation**
   - Check application logs for errors
   - Review recent deployments or changes
   - Check infrastructure status (Render dashboard)
   - Verify database connectivity and health

3. **Initial Communication**
   - Update status page to acknowledge the issue
   - Notify internal stakeholders
   - Prepare initial customer communication if needed

### Phase 2: Diagnosis (15-60 minutes)

1. **Detailed Investigation**
   - Analyze error logs and patterns
   - Check server metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Review database performance metrics
   - Check network connectivity and DNS
   - Verify external dependencies (AI services, etc.)

2. **Identify Potential Causes**
   - Recent code deployments
   - Configuration changes
   - Infrastructure issues
   - Database problems
   - External dependency failures
   - Security incidents

3. **Document Findings**
   - Record all observations in incident channel
   - Update incident timeline
   - Share diagnostic information with team

### Phase 3: Mitigation (1-2 hours)

1. **Implement Temporary Fixes**
   - Roll back recent deployments if they caused the issue
   - Restart services if appropriate
   - Scale up resources if under load
   - Implement traffic routing changes if needed
   - Enable maintenance mode if necessary

2. **Verify Mitigation**
   - Run synthetic monitoring tests
   - Check health endpoints
   - Verify from multiple locations
   - Test critical functionality

3. **Update Communication**
   - Update status page with mitigation progress
   - Notify stakeholders of progress
   - Provide ETA for full resolution if possible

### Phase 4: Resolution (2-4 hours)

1. **Implement Permanent Fixes**
   - Deploy code fixes if required
   - Update configurations
   - Adjust infrastructure as needed
   - Fix database issues

2. **Verify Resolution**
   - Run full suite of synthetic tests
   - Monitor error rates and performance
   - Verify all critical functionality
   - Check from multiple locations/devices

3. **Final Communication**
   - Update status page to resolved
   - Send resolution notification to stakeholders
   - Prepare post-incident communication if needed

## Specific Troubleshooting Procedures

### Application Server Issues

1. **Check Application Logs**
   ```bash
   # View recent logs
   cat logs/combined.log | grep ERROR
   ```

2. **Verify Process Status**
   ```bash
   # Check if Node.js process is running
   ps aux | grep node
   ```

3. **Restart Application Server**
   ```bash
   # Restart the service
   npm run restart
   ```

4. **Check Memory Usage**
   ```bash
   # Check memory usage
   free -m
   ```

### Database Issues

1. **Check Database Connectivity**
   ```bash
   # Test MongoDB connection
   mongo --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"
   ```

2. **Verify Database Status**
   - Check MongoDB Atlas dashboard
   - Verify connection string in environment variables
   - Check for database locks or long-running queries

3. **Database Recovery**
   - Restore from recent backup if data corruption
   - Repair database if needed
   - Scale up database resources if under load

### Infrastructure Issues

1. **Check Render Dashboard**
   - Verify service status
   - Check for platform incidents
   - Review resource utilization

2. **DNS and Network**
   ```bash
   # Check DNS resolution
   dig chatbot-fluxa.com
   
   # Check network connectivity
   ping chatbot-fluxa.com
   traceroute chatbot-fluxa.com
   ```

3. **SSL/TLS Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check SSL certificate
   openssl s_client -connect chatbot-fluxa.com:443 -servername chatbot-fluxa.com
   ```

### External Dependency Issues

1. **Check AI Service Status**
   - Verify OpenAI status page
   - Check Google Gemini status page
   - Test API keys and quotas

2. **Implement Fallback**
   - Switch to alternative AI provider
   - Enable degraded mode with limited functionality
   - Serve cached responses if appropriate

## Post-Incident Activities

### Immediate Follow-up

1. **Monitor for Recurrence**
   - Keep heightened monitoring for 24 hours
   - Watch for similar patterns or errors
   - Verify all systems remain stable

2. **Document Incident**
   - Complete incident timeline
   - Document all actions taken
   - Record impact and duration

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Conduct Post-Mortem Meeting**
   - Schedule within 48 hours of resolution
   - Include all incident responders
   - Review timeline and actions

2. **Identify Root Cause**
   - What caused the outage?
   - Why wasn't it caught earlier?
   - What factors contributed to the impact?

3. **Document Findings**
   - Create detailed RCA document
   - Share with relevant stakeholders
   - Update knowledge base

### Preventive Measures

1. **Immediate Improvements**
   - Fix underlying issues
   - Improve monitoring for similar issues
   - Update alerting thresholds if needed

2. **Long-term Improvements**
   - Identify systemic issues
   - Improve testing procedures
   - Enhance deployment safeguards
   - Update documentation and playbooks

3. **Track Action Items**
   - Create tickets for all action items
   - Assign owners and deadlines
   - Schedule follow-up review
