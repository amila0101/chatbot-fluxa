# External Dependency Failure Playbook

This playbook provides a structured approach for responding to external dependency failures in the Chatbot Fluxa application. External dependencies include third-party APIs, services, and infrastructure components that the application relies on but does not directly control.

## Severity Classification

| Aspect | Classification | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Default Severity** | P2 - High | May be escalated to P1 if critical functionality is affected |
| **Response Time** | 1 hour | Team must acknowledge and begin response |
| **Resolution Time Target** | 8 hours | Maximum time to implement workarounds or alternatives |
| **Escalation Path** | Technical Lead â†’ Engineering Manager | Escalate if not resolved within timeframes |

## Key External Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Criticality | Impact if Unavailable |
|------------|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Google Gemini API** | AI Service | Critical | Chat functionality degraded or unavailable |
| **OpenAI API** | AI Service | Critical | Chat functionality degraded or unavailable |
| **MongoDB Atlas** | Database | Critical | Application completely unavailable |
| **Render** | Hosting | Critical | Application completely unavailable |
| **Auth0** | Authentication | High | Users unable to log in, but existing sessions work |
| **Stripe** | Payment | Medium | Users unable to subscribe to premium features |
| **SendGrid** | Email | Medium | Notifications and password resets unavailable |
| **Cloudflare** | CDN/DNS | High | Application may be unreachable |

## Triggers

An external dependency failure incident may be triggered by:

- **Automated Alerts**:
  - External API error rates exceed threshold (>5% for 5 minutes)
  - External API response times exceed threshold (>5000ms for 5 minutes)
  - External service health check failures
  - Synthetic monitoring tests failing for external service integration

- **User Reports**:
  - Users reporting specific features not working
  - Customer support reporting patterns of similar issues

- **Internal Detection**:
  - Team member notices feature failures
  - Error logs showing external service issues
  - Monitoring dashboards showing dependency problems

- **External Notification**:
  - Vendor status page reporting incidents
  - Vendor direct communication about outages
  - Social media reports of widespread service issues

## Initial Assessment

### 1. Verify the Dependency Failure

- Confirm that the external dependency is actually failing
- Test the dependency from multiple locations if possible
- Check the vendor's status page for reported incidents
- Determine if the issue is total failure or degraded performance

### 2. Assess Impact

- Identify affected functionality in the application
- Estimate the number of affected users
- Determine if there are workarounds available
- Assess business impact (revenue, user experience, etc.)

### 3. Identify Scope

- Determine if the issue is limited to a specific region or global
- Check if the issue affects all users or a specific segment
- Verify if multiple dependencies are affected (cascading failure)
- Estimate the potential duration based on historical incidents

## Response Procedure

## Specific Dependency Failure Procedures

### AI Service Failure (Google Gemini / OpenAI)

1. **Detection**
   - Monitor error rates from AI service calls
   - Watch for timeout patterns or error responses
   - Check vendor status pages:
     - [Google AI Status](https://status.cloud.google.com/)
     - [OpenAI Status](https://status.openai.com/)

2. **Mitigation Steps**
   ```javascript
   // Implement fallback between providers
   async function getAIResponse(prompt) {
     try {
       // Try primary provider
       return await callPrimaryAIProvider(prompt);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Primary AI provider failed:', error);
       
       try {
         // Fall back to secondary provider
         return await callSecondaryAIProvider(prompt);
       } catch (fallbackError) {
         console.error('Secondary AI provider also failed:', fallbackError);
         
         // Fall back to cached or pre-generated responses
         return getPreGeneratedResponse(prompt);
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **User Experience Adjustments**
   - Display maintenance message in chat interface
   - Offer limited functionality with pre-generated responses
   - Provide transparency about the issue
   - Set appropriate expectations for response quality

### Database Service Failure (MongoDB Atlas)

1. **Detection**
   - Monitor database connection errors
   - Watch for query timeout patterns
   - Check MongoDB Atlas status page
   - Monitor for specific error codes

2. **Mitigation Steps**
   ```javascript
   // Implement read-only mode with cached data
   app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
     if (!isDatabaseAvailable()) {
       if (req.method === 'GET') {
         // Try to serve from cache for read operations
         const cachedData = await getFromCache(req.url);
         if (cachedData) {
           return res.json({
             data: cachedData,
             notice: "Using cached data due to database maintenance"
           });
         }
       } else {
         // Reject write operations during outage
         return res.status(503).json({
           error: "Service temporarily unavailable for write operations",
           retryAfter: 1800 // 30 minutes
         });
       }
     }
     next();
   });
   ```

3. **User Experience Adjustments**
   - Enable read-only mode for the application
   - Display maintenance banner
   - Disable features requiring database writes
   - Provide clear messaging about temporary limitations

### Hosting Service Failure (Render)

1. **Detection**
   - Monitor application availability
   - Watch for deployment or scaling issues
   - Check Render status page
   - Monitor infrastructure metrics

2. **Mitigation Steps**
   - If partial outage, route traffic to healthy regions
   - Activate static fallback site if complete outage
   - Consider emergency deployment to alternative platform
   - Implement DNS changes if necessary

3. **User Experience Adjustments**
   - Deploy static maintenance page
   - Provide estimated resolution time if available
   - Offer alternative contact methods
   - Consider temporary service through alternative channels

### Authentication Service Failure (Auth0)

1. **Detection**
   - Monitor authentication success rates
   - Watch for token validation failures
   - Check Auth0 status page
   - Monitor for specific error patterns

2. **Mitigation Steps**
   ```javascript
   // Extend token validity during outage
   function validateToken(token) {
     try {
       // Normal validation
       return standardValidation(token);
     } catch (error) {
       // If Auth0 is down and token format is valid
       if (isAuth0Outage() && hasValidTokenFormat(token)) {
         // Perform basic validation without online verification
         // Only do this during confirmed Auth0 outages
         return emergencyValidation(token);
       }
       throw error;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **User Experience Adjustments**
   - Extend session timeouts
   - Disable features requiring fresh authentication
   - Provide clear messaging about login limitations
