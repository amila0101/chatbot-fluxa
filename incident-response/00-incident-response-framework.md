# Incident Response Framework

This document outlines the general framework for responding to incidents in the Chatbot Fluxa application. It provides a structured approach to incident management that applies across all incident types.

## Incident Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Resolution Time | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| P1 - Critical | Service is down or unusable for all users | 15 minutes | 4 hours | • Complete service outage<br>• Database unavailable<br>• Security breach |
| P2 - High | Major functionality is impaired or service is degraded | 1 hour | 8 hours | • Significant performance degradation<br>• AI service failures<br>• Authentication issues |
| P3 - Medium | Minor functionality is impaired but service is operational | 4 hours | 24 hours | • Non-critical feature unavailable<br>• Intermittent errors<br>• UI/UX issues |
| P4 - Low | Non-critical issues that don't affect service availability | 24 hours | 72 hours | • Minor visual defects<br>• Documentation issues<br>• Enhancement requests |

## Incident Response Team Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Incident Commander (IC)** | • Coordinates the overall response<br>• Makes critical decisions<br>• Ensures communication flow<br>• Declares incident start/end |
| **Technical Lead** | • Leads technical investigation<br>• Coordinates troubleshooting<br>• Implements technical solutions<br>• Provides technical updates |
| **Communications Lead** | • Updates stakeholders<br>• Drafts external communications<br>• Manages status page updates<br>• Coordinates with customer support |
| **Scribe** | • Documents timeline of events<br>• Records key decisions<br>• Captures action items<br>• Prepares post-incident report |

## Incident Response Lifecycle

### 1. Detection

**Objective**: Identify that an incident is occurring as quickly as possible.

**Key Activities**:
- Monitor alerts from automated systems (UptimeRobot, Sentry, synthetic monitoring)
- Receive and validate reports from users or team members
- Assess initial severity and impact
- Determine if incident response should be initiated

**Tools**:
- Monitoring dashboards
- Alert notifications (email, Slack)
- Synthetic monitoring reports
- User reports

### 2. Response Initiation

**Objective**: Assemble the appropriate team and begin coordinated response.

**Key Activities**:
- Declare an incident and assign severity level
- Notify appropriate team members based on severity
- Assign incident roles (IC, Technical Lead, etc.)
- Create incident channel in Slack
- Start incident documentation

**Tools**:
- Incident management system
- Slack
- On-call rotation schedule
- Incident documentation template

### 3. Investigation

**Objective**: Determine the root cause of the incident.

**Key Activities**:
- Gather and analyze relevant data
- Review recent changes or deployments
- Identify affected components and dependencies
- Form and test hypotheses about root cause
- Document findings in real-time

**Tools**:
- Logs and monitoring data
- Deployment history
- Version control system
- Infrastructure diagrams

### 4. Mitigation

**Objective**: Restore service to users as quickly as possible.

**Key Activities**:
- Implement temporary fixes to restore service
- Roll back recent changes if they caused the issue
- Apply configuration changes or scaling adjustments
- Implement workarounds if necessary
- Verify service restoration

**Tools**:
- Deployment tools
- Infrastructure management tools
- Database management tools
- Rollback procedures

### 5. Resolution

**Objective**: Fully resolve the incident with permanent fixes.

**Key Activities**:
- Implement permanent fixes
- Test fixes thoroughly
- Deploy fixes to production
- Verify all affected systems are functioning properly
- Declare incident resolved

**Tools**:
- Version control system
- CI/CD pipeline
- Testing frameworks
- Deployment tools

### 6. Post-Incident Activities

**Objective**: Learn from the incident and improve systems and processes.

**Key Activities**:
- Conduct post-incident review meeting
- Document root cause analysis
- Identify preventive measures
- Create action items for improvements
- Update documentation and playbooks

**Tools**:
- Post-incident review template
- Action item tracking system
- Knowledge base
- Incident response playbooks

## Communication Guidelines

### Internal Communication

- Use dedicated incident Slack channel for all communications
- Provide regular status updates (at least every 30 minutes for P1/P2)
- Keep updates clear, concise, and factual
- Avoid blame or speculation
- Document key decisions and their rationale

### External Communication

- Provide timely updates on status page
- Be transparent but avoid technical details
- Focus on impact, timeline, and mitigation steps
- Acknowledge issues promptly
- Provide regular updates during extended incidents
- Follow up with root cause when appropriate

## Escalation Paths

### Technical Escalation

1. **On-call Engineer**
   - First responder to all alerts
   - Performs initial triage and response

2. **Technical Lead**
   - Escalated to when on-call engineer needs assistance
   - Provides deeper technical expertise

3. **Engineering Manager**
   - Escalated to for resource allocation
   - Helps remove organizational blockers

4. **CTO/VP Engineering**
   - Escalated to for critical incidents (P1)
   - Makes high-level technical decisions

### Business Escalation

1. **Product Manager**
   - Informed of P2 and higher incidents
   - Helps prioritize response vs. other work

2. **Customer Success Manager**
   - Informed when customers are significantly impacted
   - Manages customer communications

3. **COO/CEO**
   - Informed of P1 incidents
   - Makes business decisions during critical incidents

## Documentation Requirements

### During Incident

- Timeline of key events
- Actions taken and their outcomes
- Key decisions and their rationale
- Current understanding of the issue
- Mitigation steps in progress
- Communication sent to stakeholders

### Post-Incident

- Incident summary
- Timeline of events
- Root cause analysis
- Impact assessment
- Resolution steps taken
- Lessons learned
- Action items for improvement

## Tools and Resources

### Monitoring and Alerting

- UptimeRobot: System availability monitoring
- Sentry: Error tracking and performance monitoring
- Synthetic Monitoring: Automated user journey testing
- Render Dashboard: Infrastructure metrics

### Communication
