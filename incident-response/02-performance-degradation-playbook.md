# Performance Degradation Playbook

This playbook provides a structured approach for responding to performance degradation incidents in the Chatbot Fluxa application. Performance degradation is defined as a significant slowdown in application responsiveness that impacts user experience but does not cause a complete outage.

## Severity Classification

| Aspect | Classification | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Default Severity** | P2 - High | May be escalated to P1 if impact is severe |
| **Response Time** | 1 hour | Team must acknowledge and begin response |
| **Resolution Time Target** | 8 hours | Maximum time to resolve the incident |
| **Escalation Path** | Technical Lead â†’ Engineering Manager | Escalate if not resolved within timeframes |

## Triggers

A performance degradation incident may be triggered by:

- **Automated Alerts**:
  - API response times exceed thresholds (> 3000ms for 5 minutes)
  - Page load times exceed thresholds (> 5000ms for 10 minutes)
  - CPU/memory utilization above 80% for 15 minutes
  - Database query times exceed thresholds
  - Synthetic monitoring performance tests fail

- **User Reports**:
  - Multiple users reporting slow application performance
  - Customer support reporting widespread latency issues

- **Internal Detection**:
  - Team member notices slow performance
  - Performance monitoring tools show degradation trends

## Initial Assessment

### 1. Verify the Performance Issue

- Reproduce the performance issue from different locations
- Measure response times for key endpoints
- Check if the issue affects all users or a specific segment
- Determine if the issue is consistent or intermittent

### 2. Assess Impact

- Estimate the number of affected users
- Identify affected functionality
- Measure the severity of performance degradation
- Determine business impact (user experience, conversion rates, etc.)

### 3. Identify Scope

- Determine if the issue is limited to specific components
- Check if the issue is related to specific user actions
- Verify if third-party dependencies are involved
- Check recent deployments or changes

## Response Procedure

### Phase 1: Immediate Response (0-60 minutes)

## Specific Troubleshooting Procedures

### Application Performance Issues

1. **Profile API Endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Use synthetic monitoring to profile endpoints
   npm run monitor:performance
   ```

2. **Check Application Logs for Slow Operations**
   ```bash
   # Search for slow operations in logs
   grep "took [0-9][0-9][0-9]ms" logs/combined.log
   ```

3. **Memory Leak Investigation**
   ```bash
   # Check memory usage over time
   node --inspect server.js
   # Then connect Chrome DevTools and take heap snapshots
   ```

4. **Code Optimization**
   - Review recent code changes for performance regressions
   - Check for N+1 query patterns
   - Look for inefficient algorithms or data structures
   - Verify proper use of async/await patterns

### Database Performance Issues

1. **Identify Slow Queries**
   ```javascript
   // Enable MongoDB profiling
   db.setProfilingLevel(2, 100); // Log queries taking > 100ms
   
   // Analyze slow queries
   db.system.profile.find().sort({millis: -1}).limit(10)
   ```

2. **Check Index Usage**
   ```javascript
   // Analyze query execution plan
   db.collection.find({...}).explain("executionStats")
   ```

3. **Optimize Indexes**
   ```javascript
   // Create appropriate indexes
   db.collection.createIndex({ field: 1 })
   ```

4. **Connection Pool Issues**
   - Check for connection leaks
   - Verify connection pool configuration
   - Monitor active connections

### Resource Utilization Issues

1. **CPU Utilization**
   ```bash
   # Check CPU usage
   top -b -n 1
   ```

2. **Memory Usage**
   ```bash
   # Check memory usage
   free -m
   ```

3. **Disk I/O**
   ```bash
   # Check disk I/O
   iostat -x 1 10
   ```

4. **Network Utilization**
   ```bash
   # Check network usage
   netstat -s
   ```

### External Service Performance

1. **Measure External API Response Times**
   ```javascript
   // Add timing logs for external API calls
   const start = Date.now();
   const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/endpoint');
   const duration = Date.now() - start;
   console.log(`API call took ${duration}ms`);
   ```

2. **Implement Circuit Breakers**
   ```javascript
   // Use circuit breaker pattern for unreliable services
   const breaker = new CircuitBreaker(
     async () => await callExternalService(),
     {
       failureThreshold: 3,
       resetTimeout: 30000
     }
   );
   ```

3. **Caching External Responses**
   ```javascript
   // Implement caching for external responses
   const cache = new Map();
   
   async function getWithCache(url, ttl = 60000) {
     if (cache.has(url) && cache.get(url).expiry > Date.now()) {
       return cache.get(url).data;
     }
     
     const response = await axios.get(url);
     cache.set(url, {
       data: response.data,
       expiry: Date.now() + ttl
     });
     
     return response.data;
   }
   ```
