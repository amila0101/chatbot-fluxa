# Security Incident Playbook

This playbook provides a structured approach for responding to security incidents in the Chatbot Fluxa application. Security incidents include unauthorized access, data breaches, vulnerabilities, and other security-related events that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system or its data.

## Severity Classification

| Aspect | Classification | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Default Severity** | P1 - Critical | Security incidents are treated with highest priority |
| **Response Time** | 15 minutes | Team must acknowledge and begin response |
| **Resolution Time Target** | 4 hours | Maximum time to contain the incident |
| **Escalation Path** | Security Lead → CTO → CEO | Escalate immediately for confirmed breaches |

## Triggers

A security incident may be triggered by:

- **Automated Alerts**:
  - Unusual authentication patterns (multiple failed attempts)
  - Unexpected privileged operations
  - Abnormal data access patterns
  - Security scanning alerts (CodeQL, dependency vulnerabilities)
  - Unusual traffic patterns or DDoS detection

- **User Reports**:
  - Users reporting unauthorized access to their accounts
  - Users reporting seeing other users' data
  - Suspicious communications claiming to be from the company

- **Internal Detection**:
  - Team member discovers a vulnerability
  - Unusual system behavior indicating compromise
  - Unexpected changes to code or configuration

- **External Notification**:
  - Security researchers reporting vulnerabilities
  - Law enforcement notification
  - Third-party security monitoring alerts

## Initial Assessment

### 1. Verify the Security Incident

- Confirm that a security incident has occurred
- Determine the type of incident (unauthorized access, data breach, etc.)
- Assess the credibility of the report
- Gather initial evidence without disturbing potential forensic data

### 2. Assess Impact and Scope

- Identify affected systems and data
- Determine if sensitive or personal data is involved
- Estimate the number of affected users
- Assess potential regulatory implications (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Determine if the incident is ongoing or contained

### 3. Classify the Incident

- Determine the severity based on impact and scope
- Identify the type of security incident:
  - Unauthorized access
  - Data breach
  - Vulnerability exploitation
  - Denial of service
  - Social engineering
  - Insider threat
  - Malware or ransomware

## Response Procedure

### Phase 1: Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)
