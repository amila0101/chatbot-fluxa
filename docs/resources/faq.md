### Why am I getting MongoDB connection errors?

Make sure MongoDB is running and accessible. Check your `MONGODB_URI` environment variable to ensure it's correctly configured.

### Why am I not getting responses from the AI models?

Check that your API keys are correctly configured in the environment variables. Also, ensure you have sufficient quota and that the API services are available.

### Why is the application not building correctly?

If you're having issues with the build process, try using the safe build command: `npm run build:safe`. This uses compatibility flags to avoid common build issues.
