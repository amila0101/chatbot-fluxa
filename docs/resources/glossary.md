### Docker
A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Chatbot Fluxa provides Docker configuration for containerized deployment.

## E

### Environment Variables
Configuration values that are set outside the application code. They are used to store sensitive information and configuration that varies between environments.

### Express
A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Chatbot Fluxa's backend is built with Express.

## F

### Frontend
The client-side of an application that users interact with directly. In Chatbot Fluxa, the frontend is built with React.

## G

### Gemini
Google's large language model used for generating text responses in Chatbot Fluxa.

### GitHub Actions
A CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub that automates workflows. Chatbot Fluxa uses GitHub Actions for testing and deployment.

## J

### Jest
A JavaScript testing framework used for unit and integration testing in Chatbot Fluxa.

### JWT (JSON Web Token)
A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. Used for authentication in Chatbot Fluxa.

## M

### Middleware
Software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications. In Express, middleware functions have access to the request and response objects and can modify them or end the request-response cycle.

### MongoDB
A NoSQL database used by Chatbot Fluxa to store chat messages and user data.

### Mongoose
An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Used in Chatbot Fluxa to define schemas and models for data.

## N

### Node.js
A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Chatbot Fluxa's server is built with Node.js.

### npm (Node Package Manager)
A package manager for JavaScript, used to install and manage dependencies in Chatbot Fluxa.

## O

### OpenAI
A company that develops AI models. Chatbot Fluxa can use OpenAI's GPT models for generating responses.

## R

### Rate Limiting
A technique used to control the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network, server, or application. Chatbot Fluxa implements rate limiting to prevent abuse.

### React
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Chatbot Fluxa's frontend is built with React.

### REST (Representational State Transfer)
An architectural style for designing networked applications. Chatbot Fluxa provides a RESTful API.

## S

### Server
A computer program or device that provides functionality to other programs or devices, called clients. In Chatbot Fluxa, the server is built with Node.js and Express.

### Synthetic Monitoring
Automated tests that simulate user interactions to monitor application health and performance. Chatbot Fluxa includes a synthetic monitoring system.

## T

### Tailwind CSS
A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the Chatbot Fluxa frontend.

### Theme
A set of visual styles that define the appearance of the application. Chatbot Fluxa supports light and dark themes.

### Token
In the context of AI models, a token is a chunk of text that the model processes. In authentication, a token is a piece of data that represents authorization to access resources.

## V

### Vercel
A cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. Chatbot Fluxa can be deployed to Vercel.

## W

### Webhook
A way for an application to provide other applications with real-time information. Chatbot Fluxa uses webhooks for notifications and integrations.

### WebSocket
A communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. Can be used for real-time chat functionality.
