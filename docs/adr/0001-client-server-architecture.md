# [ADR-0001] Client-Server Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to design the overall architecture for the Chatbot Fluxa application. The application needs to:

- Provide a responsive and interactive user interface
- Process user messages and generate AI responses
- Store conversation history and user data
- Scale efficiently with increasing user load
- Support multiple AI service providers
- Maintain security and data privacy

## Decision

We will implement a client-server architecture with the following components:

1. **Client Layer**: A React-based single-page application (SPA) that provides the user interface
2. **Server Layer**: An Express.js-based RESTful API that handles business logic and data persistence
3. **Data Layer**: MongoDB for data storage
4. **AI Integration Layer**: A service layer that connects to external AI providers

The architecture will follow this structure:

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │      │                 │      │                 │
│  React Client   │◄────►│  Express Server │◄────►│  AI Services    │
│                 │      │                 │      │                 │
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
        │                        │                        │
        │                        ▼                        │
        │               ┌─────────────────┐               │
        │               │                 │               │
        └──────────────►│    MongoDB      │◄──────────────┘
                        │                 │
                        └─────────────────┘
```

Key aspects of this architecture include:

- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The client handles presentation, the server handles business logic, and the database handles persistence
- **RESTful API**: Well-defined endpoints for client-server communication
- **Stateless Server**: The server does not maintain client state between requests
- **Component-Based Frontend**: Modular React components for maintainability
- **Service-Oriented Backend**: Separation of controller and service layers

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Scalability**: The separation of client and server allows each to scale independently
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to maintain
- **Flexibility**: The client and server can be developed and deployed independently
- **Performance**: The React SPA provides a responsive user experience
- **Reusability**: API endpoints can be reused by multiple clients (web, mobile, etc.)

### Negative

- **Complexity**: More complex than a monolithic architecture
- **Network Overhead**: Client-server communication adds latency
- **State Management**: Requires careful management of state between client and server
- **Security Considerations**: Need to implement proper authentication and authorization

### Neutral

- **Development Workflow**: Requires coordination between frontend and backend teams
- **Testing Strategy**: Requires both unit and integration testing approaches
- **Deployment Strategy**: Requires separate deployment pipelines for client and server

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture

A monolithic architecture would combine the frontend and backend into a single application.

**Pros**:
- Simpler development workflow
- No network overhead between frontend and backend
- Easier initial setup

**Cons**:
- Less scalable
- Tighter coupling between frontend and backend
- Less flexibility for technology choices
- More difficult to maintain as the application grows

### Microservices Architecture

A microservices architecture would break down the server into multiple smaller services.

**Pros**:
- More granular scalability
- Better isolation of concerns
- Independent deployment of services

**Cons**:
- Significantly more complex
- Overhead of service communication
- More complex deployment and monitoring
- Overkill for the current project requirements
