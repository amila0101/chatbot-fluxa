# [ADR-0002] MongoDB as Database

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Chatbot Fluxa application needs a database solution to store various types of data, including:

- Chat messages and conversation history
- User information and preferences
- Application state and configuration
- Usage analytics and metrics

The database solution should:
- Support the storage of semi-structured data with varying schemas
- Scale efficiently as the application grows
- Provide good performance for read-heavy operations
- Support easy development and testing workflows
- Integrate well with the Node.js/Express backend

## Decision

We will use MongoDB as the primary database for the Chatbot Fluxa application, with the following implementation details:

1. **MongoDB Atlas** for production deployments
2. **Mongoose ODM** for data modeling and validation
3. **MongoDB Memory Server** for testing environments
4. **Document-based data model** for flexible schema evolution

Our data model will include the following primary collections:

- **ChatMessages**: Stores user messages and bot responses
- **Users**: Stores user information and preferences
- **Analytics**: Stores usage metrics and analytics data

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Schema Flexibility**: MongoDB's document model allows for flexible schemas that can evolve over time, which is ideal for chat data that may have varying structures
- **JSON Compatibility**: MongoDB's BSON format aligns well with JSON used throughout the JavaScript stack
- **Query Performance**: MongoDB provides good performance for the types of queries our application will perform most frequently
- **Scalability**: MongoDB Atlas provides easy scaling options as the application grows
- **Developer Experience**: The Mongoose ODM provides a familiar interface for Node.js developers
- **Testing**: MongoDB Memory Server allows for isolated, in-memory database instances during testing

### Negative

- **Transaction Support**: MongoDB has limited transaction support compared to relational databases, which could impact certain operations requiring strong consistency
- **Join Complexity**: Complex relationships between data may require multiple queries or complex aggregation pipelines
- **Schema Validation**: While Mongoose provides schema validation, it's not as strict as relational databases, which could lead to data inconsistencies if not carefully managed
- **Resource Usage**: MongoDB can be more resource-intensive than some relational databases for certain workloads

### Neutral

- **Operational Complexity**: Using MongoDB Atlas reduces operational overhead but introduces dependency on a third-party service
- **Learning Curve**: Team members familiar with SQL databases may need time to adjust to MongoDB's document model
- **Cost Considerations**: MongoDB Atlas has different pricing tiers that will need to be evaluated as the application scales

## Alternatives Considered

### Relational Database (PostgreSQL)

**Pros**:
- Strong schema validation and data integrity
- Robust transaction support
- Powerful join capabilities
- Familiar SQL query language

**Cons**:
- Less flexible for evolving schemas
- More complex setup for horizontal scaling
- Potentially less natural fit for JSON/document data
- More rigid structure could slow development iterations

### Firebase Firestore

**Pros**:
- Real-time data synchronization
- Built-in authentication integration
- Serverless architecture
- Simplified client-side development

**Cons**:
- Limited query capabilities compared to MongoDB
- Potential vendor lock-in to Google ecosystem
- Less control over data storage and processing
- Could become costly at scale

### Redis

**Pros**:
- Extremely fast performance
- Built-in support for various data structures
- Great for caching and real-time features
- Low latency

**Cons**:
- Primarily in-memory, requiring additional persistence configuration
- Limited query capabilities
- Less suitable as a primary database for complex data
- Would likely need to be paired with another database solution
