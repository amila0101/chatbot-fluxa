# Guide to Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This guide explains how to use, maintain, and create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Chatbot Fluxa project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They provide a record of architectural decisions, the forces that were considered, and the rationale behind the decisions.

## Why Use ADRs?

ADRs serve several important purposes:

1. **Documentation**: They document important decisions that shape the architecture
2. **Communication**: They communicate decisions to team members and stakeholders
3. **Onboarding**: They help new team members understand why things are the way they are
4. **Future Reference**: They provide context for future changes and decisions
5. **Decision Quality**: The process of creating an ADR helps ensure decisions are well-thought-out

## When to Write an ADR

Create a new ADR when you make a significant architectural decision that:

- Affects the structure of the application
- Introduces or removes a technology
- Changes how components interact
- Impacts non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- Would be difficult or costly to change later
- Would be valuable for future team members to understand

## How to Create a New ADR

1. **Copy the template**: Start with a copy of the [ADR template](0000-adr-template.md)
2. **Assign a number**: Use the next available number in the sequence
3. **Choose a descriptive title**: The title should clearly indicate what decision was made
4. **Fill in the sections**: Complete each section of the template
5. **Review with the team**: Get feedback from team members
6. **Update the README**: Add the new ADR to the list in [README.md](README.md)
7. **Commit to version control**: Add the ADR to the repository

Example:
```bash
# Create a new ADR
cp docs/adr/0000-adr-template.md docs/adr/0006-new-decision.md

# Edit the new ADR
# ...

# Update the README.md to include the new ADR
# ...

# Commit the changes
git add docs/adr/0006-new-decision.md docs/adr/README.md
git commit -m "Add ADR-0006: New Decision"
```

## ADR Lifecycle

ADRs go through several states during their lifecycle:

1. **Proposed**: The decision is being considered but not yet accepted
2. **Accepted**: The decision has been accepted and is being implemented
3. **Deprecated**: The decision is no longer relevant but hasn't been explicitly replaced
4. **Superseded**: The decision has been replaced by a newer decision (reference the new ADR)

When an ADR changes state, update the "Status" section accordingly.

## ADR Format

Each ADR should include the following sections:

- **Title**: A descriptive title in the format "[ADR-NNNN] Title"
- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Context**: The problem statement and relevant background
- **Decision**: The decision that was made and its rationale
- **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision (positive, negative, and neutral)
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated and why they weren't chosen
- **References**: Any references consulted during the decision-making process

## Tips for Writing Effective ADRs

1. **Be concise**: Keep the ADR focused on the decision and its immediate context
2. **Use plain language**: Avoid jargon and overly technical language
3. **Include diagrams**: Visual representations can clarify complex decisions
4. **Document trade-offs**: Clearly explain the pros and cons of the decision
5. **Capture the why**: Focus on why the decision was made, not just what the decision was
6. **Consider the future reader**: Write for someone who wasn't involved in the decision
7. **Link related ADRs**: Reference other ADRs that relate to or are affected by this decision

## Maintaining ADRs

ADRs should be treated as historical documents. Once accepted, the content of an ADR should not be altered to reflect new decisions. Instead:

1. **Create a new ADR**: If a decision changes, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
2. **Update the status**: Change the status of the old ADR to "Superseded" and reference the new ADR
3. **Keep the README updated**: Ensure the README accurately reflects the current state of all ADRs
