# [ADR-0005] Serverless Deployment on Vercel

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Chatbot Fluxa application needs a deployment strategy that:

- Provides reliable and scalable hosting
- Minimizes operational overhead
- Supports both frontend and backend components
- Enables continuous deployment
- Optimizes for global performance
- Balances cost and performance requirements
- Simplifies the deployment process

We need to determine the most appropriate deployment approach that meets these requirements while considering the team's resources and expertise.

## Decision

We will deploy the Chatbot Fluxa application using a serverless approach on Vercel with the following components:

1. **Vercel Platform**: Primary hosting platform for both frontend and backend
2. **Serverless Functions**: Express server deployed as serverless functions
3. **Edge Network**: Static assets served from Vercel's global edge network
4. **MongoDB Atlas**: Managed database service for data persistence
5. **GitHub Integration**: Automated deployments from GitHub repository

The deployment architecture will be:

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │      │                 │
│  Vercel Edge    │◄────►│  Vercel Serverless │
│  (Static Assets)│      │  Functions      │
│                 │      │                 │
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
        │                        │
        │                        ▼
        │               ┌─────────────────┐
        │               │                 │
        └──────────────►│  MongoDB Atlas  │
                        │                 │
                        └─────────────────┘
```

Key implementation details:

- **Monorepo Structure**: Single repository containing both frontend and backend code
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration managed through Vercel's environment variables
- **Preview Deployments**: Automatic preview deployments for pull requests
- **Production Deployments**: Automated deployments from the main branch
- **Custom Domains**: Custom domain configuration with automatic SSL

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Automatic Scaling**: Serverless functions scale automatically based on demand
- **Global Performance**: Edge network provides low-latency access globally
- **Operational Simplicity**: Minimal infrastructure management required
- **Integrated CI/CD**: Built-in continuous deployment from GitHub
- **Preview Environments**: Automatic preview deployments for pull requests
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-use pricing model for lower traffic applications

### Negative

- **Cold Start Latency**: Serverless functions may experience cold start delays
- **Execution Time Limits**: Serverless functions have execution time limitations
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependency on Vercel's platform and features
- **Limited Customization**: Less control over the underlying infrastructure
- **Debugging Complexity**: Serverless environments can be more difficult to debug

### Neutral

- **Monitoring Requirements**: Need to implement appropriate monitoring for serverless functions
- **Database Connection Management**: Need to carefully manage database connections in a serverless context
- **Cost Predictability**: Costs may be less predictable with usage-based pricing

## Alternatives Considered

### Traditional VPS Hosting (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS EC2)

**Pros**:
- Full control over the server environment
- No cold start issues
- Potentially more cost-effective for consistent high traffic
- No execution time limits

**Cons**:
- Higher operational overhead
- Manual scaling configuration
- More complex CI/CD setup
- Requires more DevOps expertise

### Container Orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes)

**Pros**:
- Highly customizable deployment options
- Powerful scaling capabilities
- Platform independence
- Robust service management

**Cons**:
- Significantly higher complexity
- Steeper learning curve
- Higher operational costs
- Overkill for the current project requirements

### Platform as a Service (e.g., Heroku)

**Pros**:
- Simple deployment workflow
- Built-in add-ons for common services
- Good developer experience
- Reasonable scaling options

**Cons**:
- Higher costs at scale
- Less flexibility than Vercel for frontend deployment
- More limited geographic distribution
- Less integrated with modern frontend workflows
