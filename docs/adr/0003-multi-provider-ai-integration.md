# [ADR-0003] Multi-Provider AI Integration

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Chatbot Fluxa application relies on AI services to generate responses to user messages. We need to determine the best approach for integrating with AI providers, considering:

- Quality and capabilities of different AI models
- Reliability and availability of AI services
- Cost considerations for different providers
- Flexibility to adapt to evolving AI technologies
- Resilience against service outages or rate limiting
- Performance and latency requirements

## Decision

We will implement a multi-provider AI integration approach with the following components:

1. **Provider Abstraction Layer**: A common interface for interacting with different AI providers
2. **Primary/Fallback Strategy**: Support for automatic fallback between providers
3. **Client and Server Integration**: AI capabilities on both client and server sides
4. **Configurable Model Selection**: Ability to specify which AI model to use per request

The initial implementation will support:
- **Google Gemini** (primary provider for client-side)
- **OpenAI GPT** (primary provider for server-side)

The architecture will include:

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │      │                 │
│  Client         │◄────►│  Server         │
│  (Gemini API)   │      │  (OpenAI API)   │
│                 │      │                 │
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
        │                        │
        │                        │
        ▼                        ▼
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │      │                 │
│  Google AI      │      │  OpenAI         │
│  Services       │      │  Services       │
│                 │      │                 │
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
```

Key implementation details:

- **Fallback Mechanism**: If the primary AI provider fails, the system will automatically try an alternative provider
- **Caching Strategy**: Common responses will be cached to reduce API calls and improve performance
- **Context Management**: Conversation context will be maintained for more relevant responses
- **Configuration Options**: Environment variables and runtime configuration for API keys and model selection

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Resilience**: The application can continue functioning even if one AI provider experiences issues
- **Flexibility**: Users can choose different AI models based on their preferences or requirements
- **Cost Optimization**: Ability to route requests to more cost-effective providers for certain types of queries
- **Future-Proofing**: Easy integration of new AI models and providers as they become available
- **Performance Options**: Different models can be selected based on performance requirements

### Negative

- **Implementation Complexity**: Managing multiple providers increases code complexity
- **Consistency Challenges**: Different AI models may produce different response styles or capabilities
- **API Key Management**: Need to manage and secure multiple API keys
- **Cost Tracking**: More complex billing and cost tracking across multiple providers
- **Testing Overhead**: Need to test functionality across different providers

### Neutral

- **Deployment Considerations**: Need to ensure all API keys are properly configured in all environments
- **Documentation Requirements**: More comprehensive documentation needed for multiple integration points
- **Monitoring Needs**: Need to monitor performance and availability of multiple external services

## Alternatives Considered

### Single AI Provider Approach

**Pros**:
- Simpler implementation
- More consistent responses
- Easier monitoring and cost tracking
- Less configuration management

**Cons**:
- Single point of failure
- Less flexibility for different use cases
- Potential vendor lock-in
- Limited ability to optimize for cost/performance

### Self-Hosted AI Models

**Pros**:
- Complete control over the AI models
- No dependency on external services
- Potentially lower costs at scale
- No rate limiting or quota issues

**Cons**:
- Significantly higher operational complexity
- Substantial infrastructure requirements
- Higher upfront development effort
- Challenging to maintain state-of-the-art capabilities

### Hybrid Client/Server Approach

We chose to implement a hybrid approach with AI capabilities on both client and server sides, rather than centralizing all AI interactions on the server.

**Pros**:
- Reduced server load for client-side AI processing
- Lower latency for simple queries
- Continued functionality even with server issues

**Cons**:
- API key exposure considerations for client-side
- Potential inconsistency between client and server responses
- More complex implementation
