# [ADR-0004] JWT Authentication

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Chatbot Fluxa application requires an authentication mechanism to:

- Secure access to protected API endpoints
- Identify and authenticate users
- Support user-specific features and data
- Maintain session state across requests
- Work efficiently in a stateless server architecture
- Scale horizontally without session synchronization issues

We need to determine the most appropriate authentication approach that balances security, usability, and implementation complexity.

## Decision

We will implement JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication with the following components:

1. **Token-Based Authentication**: Use JWTs for authenticating API requests
2. **Bearer Token Scheme**: Include tokens in the Authorization header
3. **Local Storage**: Store tokens on the client side in local storage
4. **Middleware-Based Verification**: Implement server-side middleware for token validation
5. **Role-Based Access Control**: Include user roles in token claims for authorization

The authentication flow will be:

1. User provides credentials through the login interface
2. Server validates credentials and generates a JWT
3. JWT is returned to the client and stored in local storage
4. Subsequent requests include the JWT in the Authorization header
5. Server middleware validates the JWT for protected routes
6. Token expiration and refresh mechanisms handle session management

Implementation details:

- **Token Structure**: Include user ID, roles, and expiration time in token payload
- **Token Signing**: Use HMAC SHA-256 (HS256) algorithm with a secure secret key
- **Token Expiration**: Set reasonable expiration time (e.g., 24 hours)
- **Refresh Tokens**: Implement refresh token mechanism for seamless re-authentication

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Stateless Authentication**: No need to store session information on the server
- **Scalability**: Works well with horizontally scaled server instances
- **Cross-Domain**: Tokens can be used across different domains/services
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Works well with mobile applications
- **Performance**: Reduces database lookups for authentication checks
- **Decoupled**: Authentication can be handled separately from the application logic

### Negative

- **Token Size**: JWTs can be larger than session IDs, increasing request size
- **Client-Side Storage Risks**: Storing tokens in local storage has XSS vulnerability risks
- **Token Revocation**: Revoking tokens before expiration requires additional mechanisms
- **Secret Management**: Requires secure management of signing secrets
- **Token Leakage Risks**: If a token is leaked, it can be used until expiration

### Neutral

- **Implementation Complexity**: Requires proper implementation of token generation, validation, and refresh flows
- **Security Considerations**: Requires careful implementation to avoid common JWT security pitfalls
- **Dependency Management**: Relies on JWT libraries and their security updates

## Alternatives Considered

### Session-Based Authentication

**Pros**:
- Simpler to implement initially
- Easier to revoke sessions immediately
- Smaller cookie size compared to JWTs
- More familiar pattern for many developers

**Cons**:
- Requires session storage on the server
- Scaling challenges with distributed systems
- Potential performance impact from session lookups
- CSRF vulnerabilities if not properly implemented

### OAuth 2.0 with Third-Party Providers

**Pros**:
- Delegates authentication to specialized providers
- Reduces password management responsibility
- Provides additional user information
- Often includes built-in MFA options

**Cons**:
- Dependency on external services
- More complex implementation
- Potential privacy concerns
- May not align with all use cases

### API Keys

**Pros**:
- Very simple to implement
- Good for service-to-service authentication
- No expiration management needed
- Low overhead

**Cons**:
- Limited user context
- Difficult to manage at scale
- Less secure for user authentication
- No standard for transmission and storage
