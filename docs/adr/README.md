# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Chatbot Fluxa project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Why ADRs?

ADRs are used to document significant architectural decisions and their rationale. They provide several benefits:

1. **Historical context**: They explain why certain decisions were made
2. **Knowledge sharing**: They help new team members understand the architecture
3. **Decision validation**: They ensure decisions are well-thought-out
4. **Future reference**: They provide context for future changes

## ADR Structure

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Title**: A descriptive title that summarizes the decision
- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Context**: The problem statement and relevant background
- **Decision**: The decision that was made and its rationale
- **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
- **References**: Any references consulted during the decision-making process
