## Communication Channels

### Primary Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Response Time |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| GitHub Issues | Task tracking, bug reports, feature requests | Within 24 hours |
| Slack | Quick questions, daily communication | Within 4 hours during work hours |
| Email | External communication, formal announcements | Within 24 hours |
| Video Calls | Sprint planning, retrospectives, complex discussions | Scheduled in advance |

### Communication Guidelines

1. **Choose the right channel** for your message based on urgency and audience
2. **Keep discussions relevant** to the channel topic
3. **Document decisions** made in synchronous communications (meetings, calls)
4. **Use @mentions sparingly** to avoid notification fatigue
5. **Maintain a respectful tone** in all communications

## Project Management

### Project Boards

We use GitHub Projects for task management with the following columns:

- **Backlog**: Prioritized list of upcoming work
- **To Do**: Tasks planned for the current sprint
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on
- **Review**: Tasks awaiting code review
- **Done**: Completed tasks

### Sprint Cycle

1. **Sprint Length**: 2 weeks
2. **Planning**: First Monday of the sprint
3. **Daily Standup**: 15 minutes, every workday at 10:00 AM
4. **Sprint Review**: Last Friday of the sprint at 2:00 PM
5. **Retrospective**: Last Friday of the sprint at 3:00 PM

### Task Management

1. **Task Creation**: Create GitHub issues using appropriate templates
2. **Estimation**: Use story points (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
3. **Assignment**: Team members self-assign tasks from the prioritized backlog
4. **Updates**: Update task status daily in the project board
5. **Completion**: Close issues only when the work is deployed to production

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We follow a modified Git Flow model:

- **main**: Production code, always deployable
- **development**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/[name]**: New features or enhancements
- **fix/[issue-number]**: Bug fixes
- **docs/[name]**: Documentation updates
- **refactor/[name]**: Code refactoring without changing functionality

### Commit Guidelines

1. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification
2. Include the issue number in the commit message when applicable
3. Keep commits focused on a single logical change
4. Write descriptive commit messages in the imperative mood

Example:
```
feat(auth): implement password reset functionality

- Add reset password form component
- Create API endpoint for password reset
- Send reset email with token
- Add unit tests

Resolves #42
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a pull request using the appropriate template
2. Link the PR to the relevant issue(s)
3. Ensure all CI checks pass
4. Request review from at least one team member
5. Address all review comments
6. Squash and merge when approved

## Code Review Process

### Review Requirements

- All code changes require at least one review before merging
- Critical components require review from a senior team member
- Reviews should be completed within 24 hours of request

### Review Guidelines

As a reviewer:
1. Be respectful and constructive in feedback
2. Focus on code quality, not style preferences
3. Consider security, performance, and maintainability
4. Approve only when all concerns are addressed
5. Use GitHub's suggestion feature for simple fixes

As an author:
1. Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized (< 500 lines when possible)
2. Provide context in the PR description
3. Respond to feedback promptly
4. Be open to suggestions and alternative approaches
5. Mark conversations as resolved when addressed

## Meeting Protocols

### General Guidelines

1. All meetings must have a clear agenda shared in advance
2. Start and end on time
3. Designate a meeting facilitator and note-taker
4. Document decisions and action items
5. Respect everyone's time and input

### Meeting Types

#### Daily Standup

- **Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Format**: Each team member answers:
  - What did I accomplish yesterday?
  - What will I work on today?
  - Are there any blockers?
- **Rules**: Keep discussions brief, take longer conversations offline

#### Sprint Planning

- **Duration**: 1-2 hours
- **Preparation**: Backlog should be prioritized before the meeting
- **Outcome**: Clearly defined sprint goals and assigned tasks

#### Sprint Review

- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Format**: Demo completed features, discuss what was not completed
- **Participants**: Development team and stakeholders

#### Retrospective

- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Format**: Discuss what went well, what didn't, and improvements
- **Outcome**: Actionable items for the next sprint

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

1. Use JSDoc comments for functions and classes
2. Document complex logic with inline comments
3. Keep comments up-to-date when changing code
4. Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger

### Project Documentation

1. Keep README.md updated with current setup instructions
2. Document architectural decisions in the docs directory
3. Update documentation as part of the feature development process
4. Use diagrams for complex systems or workflows

### Documentation Location

- **Code-level documentation**: In the code files
- **API documentation**: In OpenAPI/Swagger files
- **User guides**: In the docs/user directory
- **Developer guides**: In the docs directory
- **Architecture decisions**: In docs/architecture

## SLA Compliance

We maintain Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for issue resolution based on priority:

| Priority | First Response | Resolution Time |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Critical | 4 hours | 24 hours |
| High | 8 hours | 48 hours |
| Medium | 24 hours | 72 hours |
| Low | 48 hours | 168 hours (1 week) |

### SLA Monitoring

1. Issues are automatically labeled based on SLA status
2. SLA compliance is reviewed weekly
3. Team members should prioritize issues approaching SLA breach
4. SLA exceptions must be documented in the issue

## Onboarding Process

We use a structured onboarding process to help new team members become productive quickly.

### Onboarding Checklist

We maintain a detailed [Onboarding Checklist](onboarding-checklist.md) that covers:

1. **Access Setup**:
   - GitHub repository access
   - Development environment setup
   - Communication channels invitation

2. **Documentation Review**:
   - Project README
   - Contributing guidelines
   - Architecture documentation
   - This collaboration protocol

3. **First Tasks**:
   - Set up local development environment
   - Fix a simple bug or add a small enhancement
   - Submit a pull request following our workflow

4. **Mentorship**:
   - Assign an experienced team member as mentor
   - Schedule regular check-ins for the first month
   - Provide feedback on initial contributions

Both new team members and mentors should use this checklist to ensure a smooth onboarding experience.

## Knowledge Sharing

### Documentation

- Maintain up-to-date documentation in the docs directory
- Document architectural decisions and their rationale
- Create tutorials for common development tasks

### Pair Programming

- Schedule regular pair programming sessions
- Rotate pairs to spread knowledge across the team
- Use pair programming for complex features or bug fixes

### Tech Talks

- Hold bi-weekly tech talks (30 minutes)
- Share new technologies, techniques, or project insights
- Record sessions for team members who cannot attend

### Code Walkthroughs

- Schedule code walkthroughs for complex features
- Use screen sharing and collaborative tools
- Focus on design decisions and implementation details

## Conflict Resolution

### Process

1. **Direct Communication**: Parties involved should first attempt to resolve the conflict directly
2. **Mediation**: If direct communication fails, request mediation from a neutral team member
3. **Escalation**: If mediation is unsuccessful, escalate to the team lead or project manager
4. **Documentation**: Document the resolution and any process changes that result

### Guidelines

1. Focus on the issue, not the person
2. Use "I" statements to express concerns
3. Listen actively to understand other perspectives
4. Propose solutions rather than just stating problems
5. Commit to the resolution once it's agreed upon

## Amendments

This document is a living guide and may be updated as our processes evolve. Proposed changes should be submitted as pull requests using the documentation template and require approval from at least two team members.
