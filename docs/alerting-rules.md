# Alerting Rules and Incident Response Procedures

This document outlines the alerting rules and incident response procedures for the Chatbot Fluxa application. It provides guidance on how to respond to various types of alerts, including severity levels, escalation paths, and resolution steps.

## Alert Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Resolution Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| P1 - Critical | Service is down or unusable for all users | 15 minutes | 4 hours |
| P2 - High | Major functionality is impaired or service is degraded | 1 hour | 8 hours |
| P3 - Medium | Minor functionality is impaired but service is operational | 4 hours | 24 hours |
| P4 - Low | Non-critical issues that don't affect service availability | 24 hours | 72 hours |

## On-Call Rotation

- Primary on-call engineer is responsible for initial response
- Secondary on-call engineer provides backup if primary is unavailable
- Rotation schedule is managed in PagerDuty
- Handoffs occur weekly on Monday at 9:00 AM
