# Issue Templates

This directory contains templates for different types of issues. When creating a new issue, you'll be prompted to choose one of these templates.

## Available Templates

- **Bug Report**: For reporting bugs or unexpected behavior
  - Use for any functionality that isn't working as expected
  - Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior
  
- **Feature Request**: For suggesting new features or enhancements
  - Describe the problem your feature would solve
  - Explain how you envision the feature working
  
- **Technical Debt**: For reporting code that needs refactoring
  - Identify areas of the codebase that need improvement
  - Explain the current impact and benefits of addressing it
  
- **General Issue**: For issues that don't fit into other categories
  - Use this for general questions, documentation issues, etc.

## Best Practices for Creating Issues

1. **Search First**: Before creating a new issue, search to see if it already exists
2. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, concise descriptions
3. **One Issue Per Report**: Create separate issues for separate problems
4. **Include Context**: Provide relevant environment details, screenshots, etc.
5. **Follow Up**: Respond to questions and update the issue as needed

## Issue Labels

Issues are automatically labeled based on the template used, but maintainers may add additional labels:

- `bug`: Something isn't working as expected
- `enhancement`: New feature or request
- `technical-debt`: Code that needs refactoring
- `documentation`: Related to documentation
- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Extra attention is needed
- `priority: high/medium/low`: Indicates priority level
